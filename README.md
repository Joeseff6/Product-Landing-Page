# Product-Landing-Page
A responsive product landing page, featuring all custom CSS.

## Description
This project is a landing page that potential customers would expect to see when visiting a website's homepage. I chose spa services and products for this webpage. 

I wrote all of the CSS in this webpage, utilizing CSS transforms, transitions, flexbox, and grid. Responsiveness is also considered in the webpage, utilizing the `clamp()` function for a majority of responsive design.

Enjoy!
